		<div>3<h3>Mobile coops: runners & wheels</h3>
                <p>Treated flooring is standard on all coops, and underneath, you'll see heavy runners made of treated lumber. This extra lift prevents rot and provides shade for resting and for hunting worms. The runners also assist loading and unloading. They're strong so you can loop a chain through and move your coop with a small tractor. This year, our carpenters come up with a new 5x8 version that comes on wheels. For this, we thank a brother-in-law. After some discussion and experimentation, he designed, welded, and tested a prototype over the winter.</p></div>
